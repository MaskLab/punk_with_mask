# CryptoPunks with mask : Hope our punks away from covid-19 virus
 
Thanks to https://github.com/larvalabs for creating cryptopunks in 2017, these lovely punks have been welcomed by crypto enthusiasts and artists all over the world.

With the spread of covid-19 virus, we found that only a few punks had masks, and considering the safety of punks, we decided to put 10,000 punks with their own unique masks.
Currently these punks are already active in Ethereum, TRON, BSC and other virtual spaces, we need to put masks on all of them to ensure their safety. In this project, we will extract the characteristics of each puck, and then combine them with their cyberspace to generate a unique mask for each punk by algorithm. Each mask has its own unique color, and some masks have breathing valves.

We hope the outbreak will end soon and the punk will be safe!
